# Project Muttley - A standalone API Blog Engine 

Project Muttley is intended for people who wish to write their own Front End and have an intuitative API that deals with all the heavy lifting. It is built using Django Rest Framework and is a working progress.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
- `git clone` the repo into your own directory and wire up the database how you see fit.
- create your virtual environment either with pipenv or prebuilt inside Pycharm
- `./manage.py makemigrations`
- `./manage.py migrate`
- `./manage.py runserver`

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Running the tests

The unit tests are currently not yet written and are a current epic. 

### And coding style tests
